Protein Alignments Simulation based on phylogenetic Trees   
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  
    
HOW TO RUN (if you already have multiple protein alignments without gaps and corresponding distance matrices):  
  
$ python random_aln_generator.v3.py -d . -w ./path-to-Alignments-database-and-Distance-matrices/ -o . -t ./path-to-tree-in-nwk-format/ -n <number of replics> -l <length>
